## Union Platform

> An application to improve the communication between labor unions and its members.

Union Platform is an application to improve the communication between labor
unions and its members. It allows users to share news and documents, enroll
through the app and upload complaints and georeferenced alerts using a drupal
powered [backend][1]. It was developed with the support of [FES Argentina][0].

### Build

The app has been tested on android.

Define your google maps api key in `android/app/src/main/res/values/secrets.xml`
or `android/app/src/VARIANT/res/values/secrets.xml`.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="google_maps_api_key">YOUR_API_KEY</string>
</resources>
```

This is needed to display and create georeferenced alerts.

If you want to send push notifications to app users you need to create a firebase
project and add your `google-services.json` file in `android/app/src/VARIANT`.

You also need to set `app_host` to your backend domain in
`android/app/src/VARIANT/res/values/strings.xml` (this is needed to open one
time login links generated by the backend).

Finally set `API_URL` (your backend url) and `FORUM_URL` (your forum url) in
`.env` (or `.env.VARIANT`).

You can then run the project with

```
$ yarn react-native run-android
```
or
```
$ ENVFILE=.env.staging yarn react-native run-android --variant=releaseStg
```

### Branding

If you want to build the app with different branding you should make some changes
(this list may be incomplete, feel free to add to it).

* Set your `app_name` in `android/app/src/VARIANT/res/values/strings.xml`.
* Set `displayName` in `app.json`. If you change the `name` you should also
* Add your tems and condition in `android/app/src/main/assets/terms-and-conditions.html`.
* Replace the logo in `android/app/src/main/assets/logo.png` with your own (this
  is used when exporting complaints in pdf format).
* Replace `src/assets/images/header.jpg` (this is used as the header for drawer navigation).
* Replace `android/app/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/launch_screen.png` (this is used as the splash screen while loading the app).
